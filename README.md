# Hello, ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer with nearly two decades of hands-on experience in computing.

## My current endeavours include:

- Designing scalable, secure systems with a focus on performance, resilience, and continuity
- Crafting tailored DevOps tooling and Kubernetes extensions to streamline operations
- Working on dApps, bridges, smart contracts, and the infrastructure that powers Web3
- Reviving cherished hobby projects

## My tech stack:

- Development: Golang, Rust, ZigLang
- Cloud: AWS
- Observability: LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir)
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Terraform, Terragrunt, Terratest, GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux)

I believe in clean code, smart automation, and building systems that last.  
I'm always up for teaming up on projects that push boundaries and bring fresh ideas to life.  
Letâ€™s connect if you're building something bold!
