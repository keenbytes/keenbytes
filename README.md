### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software and Infrastructure Engineer and my journey in the world of computing began in 1992, fostering a deep-seated enthusiasm for technology.  This extensive adventure has endowed me with a broad understanding of the multifaceted nature of IT systems development.  However, it's writing software that gives me the greatest joy.

My current endeavors include:
- ðŸ”­ Spearheading a variety of innovative Web3 projects
- ðŸŒ± Developing bespoke DevOps tools and Kubernetes utilities
- ðŸ‘¯ Reviving cherished hobby projects

I'm currently delving into Rust and Ziglang.  Also, my exploration extends to the distributed realms of Web3 and artificial intelligence.
I am keen to collaborate on projects that spark innovation and challenge the status quo.
