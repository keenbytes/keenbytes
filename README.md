### Hello, ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software and Infrastructure Engineer and my journey in the world of computing began in 1992, fostering a deep-seated enthusiasm for technology and writing software. 

My current endeavors include:
- ðŸŒ± Developing bespoke DevOps tools and Kubernetes utilities
- ðŸ‘¯ Reviving cherished hobby projects

My primary focus is Golang, though Iâ€™ve recently started exploring Rust and Ziglang.
