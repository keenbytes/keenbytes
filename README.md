### Hello, ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software and Infrastructure Engineer and my journey in the world of computing began in 1992, fostering a deep-seated enthusiasm for technology.  This extensive adventure has endowed me with a broad understanding of the multifaceted nature of IT systems development.  However, it's writing software that gives me the greatest joy.

My current endeavors include:
- ðŸ”­ Variety of innovative Web3 projects
- ðŸŒ± Developing bespoke DevOps tools and Kubernetes utilities
- ðŸ‘¯ Reviving cherished hobby projects

My primary focus is Golang, though Iâ€™ve recently started exploring Rust and Ziglang. Additionally, my interests are expanding into the distributed domains of Web3 and artificial intelligence. I'm eager to collaborate on projects that foster innovation and push boundaries.
